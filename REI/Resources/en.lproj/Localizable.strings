        This neatly finished family home is located in a particularly beautiful location in the popular new housing estate De Draai. At the front of the house you can dream away with the idyllic view of a thatched farm with grassland, trees and ditch in front. You don't have the feeling that you live in a new residential area at all!

        At the rear you have a nice view into your own backyard. This garden is neatly laid out, located on the sunny southwest and has a gate to get to the public road. In addition, here is the detached wooden shed for storing your bicycles and garden equipment.

        De Draai is a child-friendly neighborhood with a relatively large number of families. Facilities such as primary and secondary education, a supermarket, public transport (bus/train), the old center of Heerhugowaard and the Middenwaard shopping center are within walking and/or cycling distance.

        Layout of the house:

        Ground floor:
        Entrance, hall, modern meter cupboard and light toilet with fountain. The garden-oriented living room has a door to the backyard and the floor is finished with a beautiful PVC floor with underfloor heating. The contemporary open kitchen consists of 2 parallel kitchen blocks that are equipped with a 5-burner gas stove, oven, extractor hood, dishwasher and fridge freezer. The first floor can be reached via the partly open staircase.

        First floor:
        Landing with stairs to the second floor and access to all areas on this floor. At the front of the house is the largest bedroom with 2 large skylights that let in a lot of light. Then there is a modern bathroom with shower, sink and toilet. The two smaller bedrooms can be found at the rear. The first floor is heated by radiators.

        Second floor:
        Via a staircase you reach the spacious attic with skylight. You can use this space as a bedroom, study / office or hobby room. Here you will find the washing machine and dryer connection. The central heating boiler and heat recovery unit are located in a closed cabinet. There is also storage space behind the knee bulkheads.

        Garden:
        Both the front and backyard are neatly landscaped and offer opportunities to enjoy the outdoors. The backyard is located on the southwest, so you can grab quite a few hours of sunshine. There is also a detached wooden shed here.

        Details:
        - Beautiful view of farm with grassland in front;
        - Underfloor heating on the ground floor;
        - Possibility to create an extra bedroom on the second floor;
        - Energy label A;
        - Very low energy and gas costs;
        - 3 solar panels on the roof;
        - Acceptance in consultation.
